# COEN4450-DataScience-FinalProject
Data Science final project

## Project Description:

This project consists of the design and implementation of a Bayes decision classifier. 

The program has two files:
- The first has a menu that allows the user to choose between various options.
- The second is the one with all the functions that will be called. 

Functions were created to calculate:
- cross-validation
- mean
- variance
- Bayesian probability
- probability density
- confusion matrix
- accuracy
- precision
- sensitivity
- f-score

Cross-validation "10 fold" and the PCA (Principle Component Analysis) method were used to make a comparison and analyze the results.
The purpose of this project is to apply concepts learned in class about visualization, data management and classification.

## How to Install and Run the Project:

1. Open -> Anaconda Prompt

2. Install requirements:
	- pip install -U scikit-learn
	- pip install pandas
	- pip install numpy
  	- pip install matplotlib

3. Test the program:
	- Open the Spyder IDE from Anaconda Navigator
	- Open and run the file named main.py

	*make sure that all project files are in the same directory.
